Dataset of "A preliminary analysis of methods for curvature estimation on surfaces with local reliefs" 
by Elia Moscoso Thompson, Silvia Biasotti

- ply_models: folder of the 7 ply models used in [1]. Models are rotated and scaled as in Figure 2 of [1]. 
The models are represented by triangulations. All the models but model7 have no boundary. All the models 
have one shell and no handles.
- png_previews:	folder of the 7 png images of the models in ply_models.
